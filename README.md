## Project Overview

This project implements RockTalk, a ChatGPT-like chatbot webapp using Streamlit for the frontend, LangChain for the logic, and Amazon Bedrock as the backend. The webapp provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with various Language Models (LLMs) with advanced features for customization and data input.

## Key Features

- 💬 Real-time chat with streaming responses and interactive controls
- 🔍 Powerful search across chat history and session metadata
- 📝 Customizable templates for different use cases
- 🖼️ Support for text and image inputs
- 📚 Complete session management with import/export
- ⚙️ Fine-grained control over LLM parameters

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Streamlit
- Backend: Amazon Bedrock
- Logic/Integration: LangChain
- Storage: SQLite

## Chat Templates

RockTalk implements a flexible template system that allows users to save and reuse chat configurations. Templates include:

- **Configuration Persistence**: Save complete LLM configurations including model parameters, system prompts, and other settings
- **Template Management**:
  - Create templates from successful chat sessions
  - Save frequently used configurations
  - Import/Export templates for sharing
  - Duplicate and modify existing templates
- **Easy Application**:
  - Apply templates to new sessions
  - Quick-start conversations with predefined settings
  - Consistent experience across multiple chats
- **Template Metadata**:
  - Custom names and descriptions
  - Unique template IDs for tracking
  - Configuration versioning
- **Use Cases**:
  - Specialized chat personas
  - Task-specific configurations
  - Team-wide standardized settings
  - Experimental configurations

## Requirements

- Supported models: Claude, Titan, etc.

## Getting Started

To set up and run RockTalk locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   - `git clone https://github.com/tahouse/rocktalk.git && cd rocktalk`
2. (Optional) Create python environment
   - `conda create -n rock 'python=3.11'`
   - `conda activate rock`
3. Install python requirements
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. (Optional) Disable Streamlit telemetry:
   - To disable Streamlit's usage statistics collection, create or edit the Streamlit configuration file:
     - On Linux/macOS: `~/.streamlit/config.toml`
     - On Windows: `%UserProfile%\.streamlit\config.toml`
   - Add the following line to the file:

     ```shell
     mkdir -p ~/.streamlit

     cat << 'EOF' > ~/.streamlit/config.toml
      [browser]
      gatherUsageStats = false
      EOF
     ```

5. Configure AWS credentials:
   - Set up your AWS credentials for accessing Amazon Bedrock. You can do this by configuring the AWS CLI or setting environment variables.
   1. Will attempt to use default profile from your ~/.aws/config or ~/.aws/credentials
   2. Can override by setting up environment variables:
      - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
      - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION).
6. Run the application:
   - Start the Streamlit app by running:

     ```sh
     streamlit run rocktalk/app.py
     ```

7. Access the webapp:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with RockTalk.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions and budget and access to Amazon Bedrock before running the application.
